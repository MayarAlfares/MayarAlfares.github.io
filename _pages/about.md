I am a CS PhD student at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.f05.uni-stuttgart.de/en/cs/), Germany, since April 2022, jointly supervised by Prof. Andreas Bulling and Prof. Ralf KÃ¼sters from the [Institute of Visualisation and Interactive systems](https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) and the [Institute for Information Security](https://www.sec.uni-stuttgart.de/) and funded by the [University of Stuttgart AI Software Academy (AISA)](https://www.aisa.uni-stuttgart.de/). I studied for my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the [German University in Cairo (GUC)](https://www.guc.edu.eg/), Egypt, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, and Cryptography, with a special focus on privacy-preserving eye tracking.
